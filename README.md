# What is Aurora project?
It's an open source project, written in .NET Core, currently in version 3.1.

The project's goals is to show that is possible to create an architecture more simple than others and using some concepts like DDD (Design Driven Design).

## Business proposal:
This project is a simple PPE (Personal Protective Equipament) Management. The principle idea is to register workers and PPE and, with this data, allow to transfer PPE to a worker.
Besides that, this system allow that you see all PPE and who has a PPE and notify if the PPE is near to expire.

## Why Aurora?
The name Aurora came from the natural event called Aurora Borealis. It is a scientific event described by the interaction between the earth's magnetic layer and energized particles from the solar wind.

A curiosity about such an event is that what we see in photographs is not always the same image that is seen live.
